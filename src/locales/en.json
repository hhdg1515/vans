    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How often should I service my car?",
        "answer": "Luxury vehicles require service every 5,000-7,500 miles or 6-12 months, whichever comes first. However, high-performance models like AMG or Porsche may need more frequent attention. We recommend following your manufacturer's service schedule, which we can review during your first visit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is included in a car service?",
        "answer": "A comprehensive luxury car service includes: oil and filter change, brake inspection, fluid level checks, tire rotation and pressure adjustment, multi-point inspection of suspension and steering, diagnostic scan for fault codes, and battery testing. For premium brands, we use only OEM-spec parts and fluids."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is regular maintenance important?",
        "answer": "Regular maintenance preserves your luxury vehicle's performance, safety, and resale value. Modern luxury cars have complex systems that deteriorate without proper care. Preventive maintenance costs significantly less than major repairs, and maintains your vehicle's warranty coverage. Our experience shows well-maintained luxury cars retain 20-30% more value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know when my brakes need service?",
        "answer": "Warning signs include: squealing or grinding noises, vibration when braking, longer stopping distances, or dashboard warning lights. Luxury vehicles often have brake wear sensors that alert you early. We recommend brake inspection every 10,000 miles. High-performance brakes (carbon-ceramic) require specialized knowledge we possess."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I tell if my air filter needs replacement?",
        "answer": "Signs your air filter needs replacement: reduced fuel efficiency, decreased acceleration, unusual engine sounds, or check engine light. Luxury vehicles have both engine air filters and cabin air filters. We recommend engine air filter replacement every 15,000-30,000 miles, and cabin filter every 15,000 miles for optimal performance and air quality."
