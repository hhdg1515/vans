## 🎯 Closing the Deal

### If Client is Enthusiastic:
"Great! To move forward, I'll send you:
1. Invoice for $1,750 deposit (via Square/PayPal/Venmo)
2. Contract outlining scope and timeline
3. Photo specification guide (what images we need)
4. Content collection form (what text we need)

Once deposit clears, I'll start on the Services page immediately."

### If Client Needs Time:
"No problem! I'll email you:
1. This demo video (record with Loom if needed)
2. Design proposal PDF
3. Pricing breakdown
4. 3-5 competitor site comparisons showing value

Take a few days to think it over. The design work is done, so we can move fast when you're ready."

### If Client Haggles on Price:
"I understand budget concerns. Here's the breakdown:
- Average Mercedes dealer website: $10,000-25,000
- Template website (Wix/Squarespace): $0-300, but generic and not optimized
- Custom site from agency: $6,000-12,000
- This price: $3,500 for custom, luxury-brand-quality work

I can offer a package deal:
- $3,200 development (save $300)
- $180/month maintenance (save $20/month)
- **If paid in full upfront:** $3,000 total (save $500)

But code quality and design stay the same - no compromises."

## 🚨 Demo Day Red Flags to Avoid

### DON'T:
- ❌ Show the old VanLife site (`http://localhost:5174/`)

- ❌ Point out minor imperfections
- ❌ Oversell features that aren't built yet
- ❌ Promise unrealistic timelines
- ❌ Negotiate price downward immediately

### DO:
- ✅ Speak confidently about design decisions
- ✅ Emphasize Mercedes-Benz official design system
- ✅ Highlight competitive advantage (vs. template sites)
- ✅ Show mobile responsiveness proactively
- ✅ Explain ROI: "One Maybach service pays for the entire website"
- ✅ Create urgency: "Can start next week if we move forward"
